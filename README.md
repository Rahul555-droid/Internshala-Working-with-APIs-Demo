# Internshala-Working-with-APIs-Demo
A simple demo of working with APIs .Here using simple APIs of two movie sites namely tastedive and OMDB I created a movie recommmendation system

In this project I mashed up data from two different APIs to make movie recommendations. The TasteDive API lets you provide a
movie (or bands, TV shows, etc.) as a query input, and returns a set of related items. The
OMDB API lets you provide a movie title as a query input and get back data about the movie, including scores from various review sites (RottenTomatoes,IMDB, etc.).

So using these two APIs I created a movie recommendation system.
If I enter a list of movies then I will get atmost 5 movies for each movie entered that will be similar to it and the resulting output will be sorted by their rotten tomatoes rating.

In the below Image I sent two movies as input Bridesmaids and Cars and I got 10 movie recommendations sorted by their rotten tomatoes rating.

I have explained the project in more details in the .py code file
